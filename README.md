# Example: Unity Script
Example of a Unity project with very basic scripting

This gives you a simple project containing:

* A **Game Controller** script, which is responsible for respawning the player, adding score and updating the UI
* **Prefab**
* A script for an object to damage (respawn) the player
* A script to rotate a coin, which will give the player points when he comes in contact with it

This project was made in Unity 5.5
